Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance : The Server would be able to perform desired tasks in reasonable unit of time.
- Reliability : updating the database by synchronizing between database and application.
- Secuirity : Issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users of LIS only.
- Scalability : The system would be scalable to support extended number of users.
- Maintainability : The system would be easy to maintain and extend.

Scope
- The product helps the people with hearing impaired by alerting the users throough vibration, since people with hearing problem cannot hear sounds. They are alerted through different types of vibrations fixed for different notifications. There are different level of vibrations like low, medium,high.

Features

- The app allow tracking hearing status over time and can also be linked to decision-support resources that encourage users to act on hearing loss.
- The approach is used considered on the distension vibration that notifies the user of incoming messages or calls in their mobile.
- Aware of the usage of sign language as the hearing-impaired communication language, technology should be an aid for interpreting the language into easier understandable manner for people who could not understand sign language, thus to enable them to be able to communicate with others will be made easier if proper communication medium is available through mobile phones. This will also help in overcoming barriers aced by hearing-impaired communicating with hearing people.
- Audio is considered to be a less significance aspect of user since they are likely to hear, but using audio could be added advantage when the application is focused for communication between the hearing-impaired and normal people-
- Hearing-impaired might needs an application that could attract them and one of the criteria is animation. Animation is an important aspect to be considered for hearing-impaired application (Adamo-Villani, 2007; Zhou et al., 2012). It will help the mind to relate graphic and it could enable the curiosity among these slow learners to utilize the application. While usage of text (captioning) on the other hand is important for creating a relationship between the animation and video would enable the learner to enjoy the learning process and make them engaged towards the application.
- Four main requirements that generally used in mobile development which are: 1) Consistent 2) Offline and online operations 3) Seamless connectivity 4) Multi-platform supports 5) Optimized power use and performance.
